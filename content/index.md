# Welcome to Arizona Friends of Homeless.

AFOHâ€™s mission is to provide services, resources, and a dose of kindness to the local homeless population in Phoenix and other parts of Arizona. This is accomplished via local outreach, social media, and our projects.
We are laser-focused on helping with homelessness issues in AZ.

AFOH is supported by local contributions and works with other organizations, groups, and individuals to give the homeless of Arizona the support they need every day on the street.
